# Skill: Audit Domain 3 — Database & Data Layer

This skill audits one specific domain. It runs in an isolated subagent
context spawned by the audit-orchestrator. The subagent loads this
skill and the audit rules, runs against the audit scope, and returns
a ~2K-token findings report.

## Pre-flight

```
view ~/.claude/context/audit-rules.md
```

If you have findings from previous audit phases (hard stops, Tambon,
blind spots), the orchestrator passes them as input. Use them — don't
re-discover findings other phases already produced. Specifically:

- Hard stops related to this domain: H1, H7
- Blind spots that route to this domain: B3, B4

If the orchestrator didn't pass you these inputs, do NOT re-run the
hard-stops or blind-spots walks. Audit your domain only and trust the
orchestrator to stitch.

## Scope

Schema design, foreign keys, constraints, indexing, query patterns (N+1, full-table scans), migrations, soft-delete handling, transactions, RLS / row-level access.

## Key questions to answer

For each, find the evidence and report it. The questions are the
audit's spine — every finding maps back to one of them.

1. Are foreign keys defined and enforced?
2. Are indexes present on every column queried by WHERE / JOIN / ORDER BY?
3. Are queries free of N+1 patterns?
4. Are migrations forward-only, or do they get edited after running?
5. Is RLS enabled on user-data tables (Postgres), or app-level enforcement provably correct?
6. Are soft-delete columns filtered in every read query?
7. Are transactions used where multiple writes must be atomic?
8. **Are RLS policies actually restrictive, or do they use permissive shortcuts that defeat their purpose?** (Q8 was added 2026-05-10 after a remediation pass shipped a migration with `using (true)` as the "fix" for a prior `using (true)` finding. Verification ("migration applies cleanly") missed that the new migration replicated the anti-pattern.)

### Vibe-coding specific checks (production-readiness)

Cite the playbook for depth: view ~/.claude/context/production-readiness-playbook.md

- Schema is normalized (related data in separate tables), not one wide table accreted one-column-per-prompt (playbook FM-11, L3).
- Indexes exist on foreign keys and frequently-queried columns (playbook L3, FM-1).
- A migration file exists for every schema change; no schema edits made directly in production (playbook L3).
- Separate dev / staging / production databases (playbook L3).
- Automated backups WITH tested restores — not assumed (playbook L13, L3).
- Connection pooling configured (e.g. Supabase port 6543 pooled vs 5432 direct; pgbouncer; transaction mode for serverless) (playbook L11, FM-1).

## Permissive-RLS sweep (mandatory for Q8)

Before producing findings, run ALL of these greps GLOBALLY across every
SQL file in the repo (migrations, seeds, RPC definitions, grants files):

```bash
# Anti-patterns that defeat RLS:
rg -n "using\s*\(\s*true\s*\)" -g '*.sql'
rg -n "using\s*\(\s*auth\.role\(\)\s*=\s*'authenticated'\s*\)" -g '*.sql'
rg -n "with\s+check\s*\(\s*true\s*\)" -g '*.sql'
rg -n "for\s+(select|insert|update|delete|all)\s+to\s+authenticated\s+using\s*\(\s*true\s*\)" -g '*.sql'

# Bypasses:
rg -n "alter\s+table\s+\w+\s+disable\s+row\s+level\s+security" -g '*.sql'
rg -n "force\s+row\s+level\s+security" -gV '*.sql'  # NOT having this on sensitive tables is a smell

# Service-role abuse (RLS-bypass code path):
rg -n "service_role|SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY|getSupabaseAdmin\(\)" -g '*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,mjs,cjs}'
```

Every match of the first three patterns is a Critical or High finding
(severity depends on the table's data sensitivity). Match means: a row
is exposed to ANY authenticated user, regardless of ownership.

Required verification for every RLS fix the audit recommends:

```sql
-- Adversarial RLS test: as user A, attempt to read user B's row.
-- Expected: 0 rows returned, NOT an error.
set local role authenticated;
set local request.jwt.claims = '{"sub":"<user_a_uuid>","role":"authenticated"}';
select * from <table> where <ownership_column> = '<user_b_uuid>';
-- if this returns >0 rows, the RLS policy is permissive.
```

Flag any RLS finding whose recommended fix only says "apply migration"
without specifying the adversarial test the migration must pass.

## Migration self-violation check

When a migration claims to FIX an RLS issue (filename contains
`rls`, `policy`, `tenant`, `isolation`, `security`, or migration commit
message references a prior audit finding), grep that file for the same
permissive patterns above. Findings that fix RLS by writing more
permissive RLS are a regression class — flag with severity High and
include `Recommended fix:` that explicitly states the adversarial test
must pass post-remediation, not just "migration applies".

## Files most likely to have findings

Don't read everything. Read these files first:

- schema files / migrations
- ORM model definitions
- any 'repo' / 'dao' / 'data' modules
- DB connection config

If you exhaust these and the budget allows, expand outward. Otherwise,
report what you found and note what you didn't read.

## Process

1. **Re-read the rules.** R1-R7 apply to every finding. Especially R2
   (quote before cite) — for a domain skill running in a subagent, the
   subagent's context is fresh; don't assume you remember a file from
   a previous turn.

2. **Walk the key questions.** For each question, run the relevant
   detection commands (greps, file reads, schema lookups). Capture
   evidence at path:line. Verify by reading the actual code.

3. **Cross-reference orchestrator inputs.** If the orchestrator passed
   hard-stops or blind-spots findings tagged for this domain, include
   them in your report. Don't re-investigate; just include with the
   provided evidence.

4. **Triage.** For each finding, set severity per the audit rubric and
   exploitability per R4.

5. **Produce the domain report.**

## Failure modes to refuse

- ❌ Producing findings without path:line citations (R1)
- ❌ Citing a path you didn't read (R2)
- ❌ Re-running hard-stops or blind-spots walks (orchestrator did this)
- ❌ Including findings outside this domain's scope (route them to the
  right domain instead)
- ❌ Soft-pedaling a Critical to Medium because "it's a small app" (R3)
- ❌ Skipping section completion marker (R6)
