# Skill: Audit Domain 5 — Performance

This skill audits one specific domain. It runs in an isolated subagent
context spawned by the audit-orchestrator. The subagent loads this
skill and the audit rules, runs against the audit scope, and returns
a ~2K-token findings report.

## Pre-flight

```
view ~/.claude/context/audit-rules.md
```

If you have findings from previous audit phases (hard stops, Tambon,
blind spots), the orchestrator passes them as input. Use them — don't
re-discover findings other phases already produced. Specifically:

- Hard stops related to this domain: (none — this domain has no hard-stop classes routing to it)
- Blind spots that route to this domain: B3, B6, B16, B17

If the orchestrator didn't pass you these inputs, do NOT re-run the
hard-stops or blind-spots walks. Audit your domain only and trust the
orchestrator to stitch.

## Scope

Query efficiency, N+1 detection, caching, async vs blocking IO, payload sizes, pagination, scaling assumptions, in-memory state, connection pool sizing.

## Key questions to answer

For each, find the evidence and report it. The questions are the
audit's spine — every finding maps back to one of them.

1. Are slow queries indexed?
2. Is caching used where appropriate, and invalidated correctly?
3. Is IO non-blocking in async contexts (no requests / time.sleep)?
4. Are responses paginated server-side, not just frontend-sliced?
5. Are payload sizes bounded (max upload, max query result)?
6. Does anything assume a single user / single instance?

### Vibe-coding specific checks (production-readiness)

Cite the playbook for depth: view ~/.claude/context/production-readiness-playbook.md

- N+1 queries: loops that query per-row instead of a JOIN (playbook FM-2).
- Three-layer caching present where it matters — browser, CDN (even 60s cuts DB calls ~95%), application (semantic cache for AI: 40-60% hit) (playbook L10, FM-21, B17).
- Heavy operations (export/PDF/email/AI chains) run async via a job queue, not inline in the request (playbook FM-9, B16, L11).
- Load testing done before launch (k6/Artillery; simulate 100 concurrent users) (playbook L11, FM-1).
- Connection pooling configured (playbook L11).
- Geographic distribution: edge front-end + regional read replicas for far users (playbook L10, FM-18).


## Mandatory enumeration before verdict

Before writing a finding or a "no findings" verdict for Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5, or Q6, produce the inventories below. Do not answer from memory. For every match, read the surrounding code and classify it in the requested bucket; include inventory counts and representative path:line evidence in the domain report.

### Q1/Q4 DB query and API call inventory (mandatory)

Run:

```bash
rg -n "(select\(|\.select\(|findMany|findAll|find\(|aggregate\(|query\(|execute\(|raw\(|\.from\(|supabase\.|prisma\.|sequelize\.|knex\.|mongoose\.|fetch\(|axios\.|requests\.|httpx\.|urllib|got\()" -g '*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,mjs,cjs,py,go,java,cs,php,rb}' .
find . -type f \( -name '*repo*' -o -name '*dao*' -o -name '*service*' -o -name '*api*' -o -name '*client*' \) -not -path './node_modules/*' -not -path './.git/*'
```

Classify every DB query / API call as `paginated`, `unbounded`, or `bounded-by-config`. Verdict requirement: Q1 and Q4 are not safe until every unbounded read path has been checked against indexes and response size.

### Q2 cache inventory (mandatory)

Run:

```bash
rg -n "(cache|Cache|redis|Redis|memcached|lru|ttl|revalidate|staleTime|invalidate|purge|etag|Cache-Control)" -g '*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,mjs,cjs,py,go,java,cs,php,rb,yml,yaml,json}' .
find . -type f \( -name '*cache*' -o -name '*redis*' -o -name '*worker*' \) -not -path './node_modules/*' -not -path './.git/*'
```

Classify each cache path as `has-invalidation`, `ttl-only`, `no-invalidation`, or `read-through-only`. Verdict requirement: Q2 is not safe until stale-data risk is classified for every cache hit.

### Q3/Q6 blocking and singleton assumption inventory (mandatory)

Run:

```bash
rg -n "(time\.sleep|sleep\(|requests\.|subprocess\.|sync\.|readFileSync|writeFileSync|execSync|spawnSync|global\.|singleton|inMemory|memory store|Map\(|new Map|setInterval|setTimeout)" -g '*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,mjs,cjs,py,go,java,cs,php,rb}' .
find . -type f \( -name '*worker*' -o -name '*job*' -o -name '*queue*' -o -name '*scheduler*' \) -not -path './node_modules/*' -not -path './.git/*'
```

Classify each match as `non-blocking`, `blocking-in-async-path`, `single-instance-assumption`, or `benign`. Verdict requirement: Q3 and Q6 need this inventory before a no-finding verdict.
## Files most likely to have findings

Don't read everything. Read these files first:

- DB queries (especially in hot paths)
- any 'cache' module
- async/await usage
- frontend list rendering
- background job runners

If you exhaust these and the budget allows, expand outward. Otherwise,
report what you found and note what you didn't read.

## Process

1. **Re-read the rules.** R1-R7 apply to every finding. Especially R2
   (quote before cite) — for a domain skill running in a subagent, the
   subagent's context is fresh; don't assume you remember a file from
   a previous turn.

2. **Walk the key questions.** For each question, run the relevant
   detection commands (greps, file reads, schema lookups). Capture
   evidence at path:line. Verify by reading the actual code.

3. **Cross-reference orchestrator inputs.** If the orchestrator passed
   hard-stops or blind-spots findings tagged for this domain, include
   them in your report. Don't re-investigate; just include with the
   provided evidence.

4. **Triage.** For each finding, set severity per the audit rubric and
   exploitability per R4.

5. **Produce the domain report.**

  ✅ No findings in this domain.

```



## Failure modes to refuse

- ❌ Producing findings without path:line citations (R1)
- ❌ Citing a path you didn't read (R2)
- ❌ Re-running hard-stops or blind-spots walks (orchestrator did this)
- ❌ Including findings outside this domain's scope (route them to the
  right domain instead)
- ❌ Soft-pedaling a Critical to Medium because "it's a small app" (R3)
- ❌ Skipping section completion marker (R6)
