# Skill: Audit Domain 10 — Cost & Billing Risk

This skill audits one specific domain. It runs in an isolated subagent
context spawned by the audit-orchestrator. The subagent loads this
skill and the audit rules, runs against the audit scope, and returns
a ~2K-token findings report.

## Pre-flight

```
view ~/.claude/context/audit-rules.md
```

If you have findings from previous audit phases (hard stops, Tambon,
blind spots), the orchestrator passes them as input. Use them — don't
re-discover findings other phases already produced. Specifically:

- Hard stops related to this domain: H10
- Blind spots that route to this domain: B3, B6, B17

If the orchestrator didn't pass you these inputs, do NOT re-run the
hard-stops or blind-spots walks. Audit your domain only and trust the
orchestrator to stitch.

## Scope

Runaway loops, unbounded LLM/external API calls, missing rate limits on paid services, infrastructure cost amplifiers (oversized DB, over-provisioned compute), budget alerts.

## Key questions to answer

For each, find the evidence and report it. The questions are the
audit's spine — every finding maps back to one of them.

1. Can a single user trigger an unbounded number of LLM calls (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic)?
2. Are external API calls rate-limited per user?
3. Are there monthly budget alerts on the LLM / cloud account?
4. Is the infrastructure right-sized for current scale (no $500/month for 10 users)?
5. Are background jobs bounded in runtime / retries?
6. Are large-result queries (full table scans, unpaginated) bounded?

### Vibe-coding specific checks (production-readiness)

Cite the playbook for depth: view ~/.claude/context/production-readiness-playbook.md

- Expensive/paid/AI endpoints have BOTH a rate limit and a spend cap; alert at 50%, kill at 90% of budget (playbook H10, FM-5, L9).
- Model routing by complexity: cheap model for simple tasks, top model only when needed (~70% savings) (playbook FM-10).
- Semantic caching of similar AI requests (40-60% hit rate) (playbook L10, FM-10).
- Always-on resources scale to zero / are right-sized when idle (playbook L6).
- A runaway-cost path (unbounded loop or per-request paid call with no cap) is the classic AI-vibe blowup (playbook H10, FM-5).


## Mandatory enumeration before verdict

Before writing a finding or a "no findings" verdict for Q1, Q2, Q3, Q5, or Q6, produce the inventories below. Do not answer from memory. For every match, read the surrounding code and classify it in the requested bucket; include inventory counts and representative path:line evidence in the domain report.

### Q1/Q2 paid API call inventory (mandatory)

Run:

```bash
rg -n "(OpenAI|openai\.|Anthropic|anthropic\.|MercadoPago|mercadopago|AWS|boto3|S3|Textract|Comprehend|Bedrock|Twilio|twilio\.|stripe\.|sendgrid|resend|elevenlabs|replicate)" -g '*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,mjs,cjs,py,go,java,cs,php,rb,json,yml,yaml}' .
find . -type f \( -name '*client*' -o -name '*service*' -o -name '*integration*' -o -name '*billing*' \) -not -path './node_modules/*' -not -path './.git/*'
```

Classify every external paid API call as `quota-capped`, `unlimited`, or `per-request-limited`. Verdict requirement: Q1 and Q2 are not safe until every paid call path has a per-user and global cost-control classification.

### Q3 budget and infrastructure inventory (mandatory)

Run:

```bash
rg -n "(budget|alert|quota|limit|billing|cost|instance|replica|autoscale|autoscaling|size|plan|tier|vercel|render|railway|fly\.io|aws|gcp|azure|supabase)" -g '*.{tf,tfvars,yml,yaml,json,ts,js,py,md}' .
find . -type f \( -name '*infra*' -o -name '*terraform*' -o -name '*deploy*' -o -name '*billing*' -o -name '*budget*' \) -not -path './node_modules/*' -not -path './.git/*'
```

Classify each spend-control signal as `budget-alert-configured`, `quota-configured`, `right-sized`, or `no-cost-control-found`. Verdict requirement: Q3 and Q4 need this inventory before a no-finding verdict.

### Q5/Q6 background job and large-query inventory (mandatory)

Run:

```bash
rg -n "(cron|schedule|queue|worker|job|retry|while\s*\(|for\s*\(|findMany|findAll|select\(|limit\(|take:|page|pageSize|offset|cursor|batch|chunk)" -g '*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,mjs,cjs,py,go,java,cs,php,rb,sql,yml,yaml}' .
find . -type f \( -name '*worker*' -o -name '*job*' -o -name '*queue*' -o -name '*cron*' -o -name '*repo*' \) -not -path './node_modules/*' -not -path './.git/*'
```

Classify each runtime/query path as `bounded-runtime`, `unbounded-runtime`, `paginated`, or `unbounded-result`. Verdict requirement: Q5 and Q6 are not safe until runaway job and large-result risks are classified.
## Files most likely to have findings

Don't read everything. Read these files first:

- LLM client wrappers
- external API client wrappers (Stripe, MercadoPago, etc.)
- rate limiter config
- background job runners
- infra config (Dockerfile resource limits, K8s requests)

If you exhaust these and the budget allows, expand outward. Otherwise,
report what you found and note what you didn't read.

## Process

1. **Re-read the rules.** R1-R7 apply to every finding. Especially R2
   (quote before cite) — for a domain skill running in a subagent, the
   subagent's context is fresh; don't assume you remember a file from
   a previous turn.

2. **Walk the key questions.** For each question, run the relevant
   detection commands (greps, file reads, schema lookups). Capture
   evidence at path:line. Verify by reading the actual code.

3. **Cross-reference orchestrator inputs.** If the orchestrator passed
   hard-stops or blind-spots findings tagged for this domain, include
   them in your report. Don't re-investigate; just include with the
   provided evidence.

4. **Triage.** For each finding, set severity per the audit rubric and
   exploitability per R4.

5. **Produce the domain report.**

## Failure modes to refuse

- ❌ Producing findings without path:line citations (R1)
- ❌ Citing a path you didn't read (R2)
- ❌ Re-running hard-stops or blind-spots walks (orchestrator did this)
- ❌ Including findings outside this domain's scope (route them to the
  right domain instead)
- ❌ Soft-pedaling a Critical to Medium because "it's a small app" (R3)
- ❌ Skipping section completion marker (R6)
